//React Components
//React components can be composed using other components and basic HTML elements; they can respond to user input, change state, interact with other components, and much more.

//React Classes
//React classes are used to create real components.
//These classes can then be reused within other components, handle events, and so much more.
//React classes are created by extending React.Component, the base class from which all custom classes must be derived. Within the class definition, at the minimum, a render() method is needed. This method is what React calls when it needs to display the component in the UI.
//But render() is one that must be present, otherwise the component will have no screen presence. The render() function is supposed to return an element (which can be either a native HTML element such as a <div> or an instance of another React component).
